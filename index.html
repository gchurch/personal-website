    <h3>Financial Exchange Simulator</h3>
    <p><i>Feb 2019 - May 2019</i></p>
    <p>For my final year project, I created a simulator of the London Stock Exchange's Turquoise Plato trading venue in Python. The simulator is designed to be used a test bed for automated trading algorithms. My dissertation can be found <a href="https://github.com/gchurch/DarkPool/blob/master/thesis.pdf">here</a>. My work is in the process of being published in an academic journal.</p>

    <h3>Games Project - Reality Bomb</h3>
    <p><i>Oct 2016 - May 2017</i></p>
    <p>In my 3rd year, we were given the entire academic year to create a video game. I worked in a group of six students and we created an augmented reality game for iOS devices called Reality Bomb. The game was created using the Unity game engine. Throughout the project, I mostly worked in Unity (C#) on the physics and logic of the game. I also partly worked on the networking.</p>
    <p>At the end of the academic year, we had a games day where students were invited to come along and play our game.</p>
    <p>Rory, one of our group members, created the following video to showcase our game.</p>

    <h3>Web Technology</h3>
    <p><i>Summer 2018</i></p>
    <p>I took the Web Technology unit in my 3rd year. Using the skills that I learnt, I created a little website as a personal project. The website allows users to upload images which are then displayed on the site. Users can also place comments on uploaded images. The website was created with Node.js and uses the Express web framework. SQLite is used for the database. The mustache template system is used to render the html for each page. The multer middleware package is used to upload the images to the web server.</p>
    <p>A version of the website is currently deployed online and can be found <a href="https://sharing-images.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

    <h3>Superscalar Processor Simulator</h3>
    <p><i>Oct 2017 - Dec 2017, Summer 2018</i></p>
    <p>In my 4th year I took the Advanced Computer Architecture unit. This unit involved us creating a simulator of a superscalar processor. I decided to create mine using C++. Features of the processor include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A 5-stage pipeline (fetch, decode/issue, dispatch, execute, commit).</li>
      <li>Reservation stations to store instructions that are waiting for operands to be computed.</li>
      <li>Multiple execution units (load/store unit, ALUs, branch unit).</li>
      <li>Out-of-order execution of instructions using a Reorder Buffer.</li>
      <li>Register Renaming by use of a Register Allocation Table (RAT). This eliminates false data dependencies between instructions.</li>
      <li>Simple branch prediction (predicts that every branch will be taken).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also created a graphical display of the processor with SDL. Below is a GIF of the graphical display.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing Project</h3>
    <p><i>Oct 2018 - Dec 2018</i></p>
    <p>In my 4th year I took the Cloud Computing unit. In the coursework for this unit, we had to create a scalable application that uses cloud computing resources. I created a simple website that allows you to upload images which are then displayed on the homepage. The web server was created with Node.js and Express. I used AWS resources to run the application. The web server is run using Elastic Beanstalk, which allows the web server to be automatically horizontally scalable. Images that are uploaded to the website are stored in an S3 bucket. DynamoDB is used for the database. CodePipeline is used for continuous delivery. I also used Apache Jmeter to load test the application.</p>
    <p>The application can be found <a href="http://shareimages-env.ptfpgb7h3w.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Cotwold Water Park App</h3>
    <p><i>Oct 2015 - May 2016</i></p>
    <p>I worked in a group of six students to create a mobile app for the Cotswold Water Park. The app provides users with information about the water park including upcoming events and has an interactive map to help users navigate their way around the area. The app was created with AngularJS, Ionic and PhoneGap.</p>

    <h3>Computer Graphics</h3>
    <p><i>Feb 2017 - May 2017</i></p> 

    <p>In my 3rd year I took the Computer Graphics unit. For the coursework we had to create a raytracer and a rasterizer in C++ using GLM and SDL.</p>

    <p>A screenshot taken from the raytracer that I created is shown in the image on the left. The raytracer performs antialiasing, soft shadows and bounding box optimisation.</p>

    <p>The GIF on the right shows the real-time execution of the rasterizer that I created. The rasterizer performs clipping and texture mapping.</p>
