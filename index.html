    <h3>Superscalar Processor Simulator</h3>
    <p>In my 4th year I took the Advanced Computer Architecture unit. This unit involved us creating a simulator of a superscalar processor. I decided to create mine using C++. After finished the unit I continued working on it as a personal project and added a GUI. The project can be found <a href="https://github.com/gchurch/processor">here</a>.</p>
